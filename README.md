# Zelm

This is a conservative fork of the Elm compiler. It aims to preserve complete
backwards compatibility and (nearly) complete forwards comptability with the
mainline Elm compiler as of Elm 0.19.1.

We say "nearly" because there are certain bugs in the Elm compiler that will be
fixed by the Zelm compiler. In particular some code which compiles successfully
using the Zelm compiler may cause the mainline Elm compiler to crash.

Zelm's main purpose is to provide a method for bug fixes and patches

**The following is the README for the original Elm compiler:**
