# Contributing to Elm UI

Welcome!

First, if you have a question about how to do something with the library, join `#elm-ui` on the [Elm Slack](https://elmlang.herokuapp.com/)!  There are usually a number of people who are willing to help out, myself included.

That's the place to ask questions, try there first.

A few notes about my design process for `elm-ui`.

I don't usually accept PRs that add features. Mainly this is because there is a bunch of design thought and research that needs to be done before a feature can be added.

So, here are some other ways you can help if you so desire!

# Bugs and Unexpected Things

If you run into unexpected behavior, I definitely want to hear about it. Put together a [Short, Self Contained, Correct, Example](http://sscce.org/) of what you're encountering.  It really helps if the example is as succinct as possible.

Here's a basic template in [ellie](https://ellie-app.com/3fhCyrxjLw3a1) to get you started!

# Research

One of the more challenging parts of the project like this is gathering information.

If you know of good resources about accessibility, internationalization, design, or [any of the topics listed in the research folder](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-ui/tree/master/notes/research), send them my way either via PR to those documents or on slack.
